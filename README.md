# Code Refactor Starter Code
***

## General Info
This is the first assignment for the Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to refactor the code. The specific modifications I needed to make were:
* Make the code follow accessibility standards.
* Make the elements follow a logical structure.
* Make the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* Make a concise, descriptive title.
* Make sure all links function correctly.
* CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized.
